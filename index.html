<h1> The Idea Behind Todaypost</h1>
<article class = "browser">

		<p>Ever started working on something and you cant seem to actually get it over and done with? That was me when I began working on this webpage.<br> I mean, there are other, not really simpler, but quicker methods to get it done, still, I wanted to learn everything from scratch.Boy, it was really all fun and games when I started out. Everything just fell into place and every other minute I was like ;<strong> Mama I Made It</strong> until stuff got real.<br>If you write code, you can relate to how it feels when you successfully run your first "Hello World" program. Bummer! Now that we're on the same page:<br><br>Zendaya Coleman; 23 years old. Successful actor, singer and one heck of a role model.<br>Marsai Martin; if you've held a conversation with me of late then you have probably heard me talk of her. With her 15 years, she has managed to have a show of her own, is an activist and looks like an amazing daughter,<br>(which we know can be quite a challenge).<br>I am impatient for the rest of my life to start especially when majority of young adults are thriving.I can't help but awe at their achievements (don't look at me like that). One of my biggest achievement was completing this...I will not embarass myself by stating in how long...amongst others. And it's honestly not that great considering it's really not the best websites around or anything like that. For someone that's just getting started, I think I've tried yeah? Thanks :)<br>I want to be great for sure but sometimes I think it takes too long to get there.I was going to implement pagination on my blog post but we'll get there soon. I'm still not sure if I'm going to take web development full time, I mean, technology is diverse right? But I'm doing this because I enjoy doing it.<br>I'll leave my contacts in the description box below lol :) so if you are interested, you can get in touch and we can go on this journey together. <br>Cheers!<br></p>
